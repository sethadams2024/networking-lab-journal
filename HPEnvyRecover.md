Hello! This is to help recover and fix a HP Envy x360 Laptop

Context: 
- This device was bought in 2021 for college, yet would randomly stop working and never boot again.
- It was sent to HP numerous times and issue persisted.
- Now that I have more learning and support, I can try fixing the issue myself. If not, I can strip it for parts (126GB SSD)
