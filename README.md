# networking-lab-journal
This is a journal to log the various networking projects, labs, and certification learning I am doing daily.

Ultimate Goals of my journal:
- Get into networking
- Break into the IT field.
- Show the knowledge I have gained, the mistakes I have made, and much more.

Day 1
- I was able to purchase some items from a garage sale:
  1. D-Link DIR-615 Wireless N router. It has 4 LAN ports and wireless connectivity.
  2. 7ft of Cat 5e. I needed another cable so that I could use the D-Link and my PC with Ethernet.
  3. A new Type C hub that offers Ethernet connectivity for my Surface Pro 7. I did not have one with my other version.
  4. A NetGear Base Station VMB3000. I now understand that this is completely useless unless I make huge changes to its items.
 
  Here are my Plans for the upcoming weeks
  - Take out the insides of the NetGear and put a Raspberry Pi in it to detect my internet traffic by hiding it as another device.
  - Connect the D-Link and be able to configure it in different ways and learn about what it can do. I also saw that I can flash something onto it and make it more powerful.
  - I am also a Master's student in Information Science, and that is a higher priority.
  - I am also studying for A+ certification, and doing Cisco's "Network Technician" Badge course.
