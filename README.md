<H1> Hello, my name is Seth Adams!</H1>

<h2> About me:</h2>
<p> I am a recent B.S. Grad from Texas A&M University. For the past 6 months, I have been a data systems coordinator for a Clinical Education Company.
I recently delved full into networking as the future of my career path, and I am using <b>THIS GITHUB</b>  to show the progress, the learning, the failures, and successes of my journey</p>

<h2> Here are my projects and items that I am doing</h2>

[My day-to-day learning summaries](day_to_day)

I will clean this up over time.
