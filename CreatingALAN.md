<h3> Cable Management</h3>

Before I can even start, I need to clean my "workstation," which has double the number of cables now.
Because of the temporary environment, I decided to use masking tape, which is easy to use and take off when needed.
I managed the 3 power cables (PC1, PC2, Monitor) together and had to first take it closer to PC2 since its a closed case and on the bottom of my desk. It was tricky getting it to be as tight as possible, as the other 2 cables came up and formed a Y shape when they connected to the monitor and PC1.

Due to there only being a double outlet, I have a surge protector that has combined all 3 power cables. I cannot have both PC's running simultaneously due to the sheer demand of power. So now, there is also the switch power cable, and two USB ports in the other outlet (this outlet has two USB cables (3.0, I think). These are managed to follow the shape of the desk then route through the back of a small hole in the router and then go their persepctive ways.

I also added an HDMI Splitter to ease the process of not removing cables and having the risk of damaging something.

<h1> Setting up  the router</h1>

Okay, first, I had to clean the area where the router would go. I have cats, and there were little pieces of litter in the area.

I then had to cable manage the numerous devices present by the TV. I brought all the wires to an open shelf in the TV stand. Makes it easier to access them and not get eaten up by the cats

Time to start configuring

1. I connected the Cat 6 UDP Ethernet cable to the wall port and plugged it into the router. I then plugged the existing cable into LAN PORT 1 and connected the end to my gaming PC.

Now I am following the manual for the router
1. Connected to the wifi connection
2. Went to 192.168.0.1 on my browser, but this did not work
   **Solution** I went to settings -> Network and Wifi -> and clicked on the router connection. I then looked at the Default Gateway, which was 192.168.10.1
4. I am in the router now

5. Changing the Settings


   a. Changed the password to access the router itself
   b. Changed the Wifi name and password, and changed the encryption to WPA2-PSK
   c. Due to not having access to the router, I have it set to DHCP
   d. I changed the bandwidth to 40MHz from 20MHz. Since my connections are wired and the living room connections are wireless, there won't be any interference or blockage
   e. I installed WifiInfoView to see the channel usage. My router was using channel 10, but knowing 1 6 and 11 are the best, I chose channel 6 because it had the loweest % (17%)


   <h2> Thinking about security</h2>

   as I plugged the router in, I came to realize why you do not purchase a $20 router, it isn't protected well. It has TKIP which stands for Temportal Key Integrity Protocol. 


   for the time being, I disconnected the router and went to switch only.
   1. connected the switch to the ehternet wall port, the  connected it to the gaming pc
   2. had trouble getting the right IP. So I downloaded ProSAFE Plus Utility and it helped discover the IP, and got to the config page.

---

## 🛠 Initial Goals

1. Integrate Cisco Catalyst 2960 into home LAN
2. Understand basic switching, VLANs, and interface behavior
3. Run internet traffic through the Cisco switch
4. Prepare for router/firewall integration later

---

## 🔌 Initial Physical Setup

[Apartment Wall Ethernet]  → [Cisco 2960 Gi0/2]  → [Cisco 2960 Gi0/1]  → PC




> Previously:
> Apartment Wall → Netgear → PC (800 Mbps speed test)

---

## ⚙️ Basic Switch Configuration

```plaintext
hostname SW1
!
interface Vlan1
 ip address 172.16.230.10 255.255.255.0
 no ip route-cache
!
ip default-gateway 172.16.230.1
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 switchport mode access
 no shutdown
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/2
 switchport mode access
 no shutdown
Confirmed:

Switch responds to ping on 172.16.230.10

Interfaces are up/up

```

🧪 Testing & Troubleshooting

✅ Link Tests
Test	Result

PC → Netgear (direct)	✅ ~800 Mbps

PC → 2960 (Gi0/1)	❌ ~220 Mbps

Apartment wall → Netgear → PC	✅ ~800 Mbps

Apartment wall → 2960 → PC	❌ ~220 Mbps

❓ Why the Drop?
Investigated and ruled out:

✅ Cable quality (Cat5e)

✅ Gigabit link status on PC and switch (a-full a-1000)

✅ Clean config, no ACLs or QoS in place

✅ Switch port statistics showed no major errors

📉 Root Cause Analysis
Possible Cause	Outcome
Internal switching backplane limit	Likely ✔️
Hardware limitation of 2960 (older model)	Confirmed
Duplex mismatch	❌ Not observed
Interface errors (CRC/input/output)	❌ Clean stats
ISP cap or shaping	❌ 800 Mbps via Netgear proves otherwise

🧩 Workaround Strategy
🟢 Use Cisco 2960 for lab/testing only

🔁 For high-speed gaming and downloads, route through Netgear

⚙️ Add router/firewall/VLAN later for advanced testing

📌 Notes & Tips
Cisco 2960 has shared internal bus on gigabit ports — not true line-rate under load

Use show interface gi0/1 to verify link speed and errors

Store config with: write memory or copy running-config startup-config

Can run speed and duplex commands to hard-set link negotiation if needed

📈 Next Steps
 Integrate Cisco 1900 router and setup NAT/DHCP

 Add VLANs to the 2960 for segmentation

 Bring Cisco ASA 5520 online for security testing

 Connect and configure F5 Big-IP 3600 for load balancing simulation


# Networking Lab Recap

## Setup Overview
- Devices:
  - Cisco 1921 Router (IOS 15.4(3)M3)
  - Netgear Switch
- Goal: Configure a basic home/office network with NAT to allow LAN devices internet access.
- IP scheme decided: Use 172.16.230.0/24 for WAN side and 10.10.10.0/24 for LAN side.

---

## Step 1: Initial Attempts and Troubleshooting

### Issues Encountered:
- Ethernet adapter showed "Unidentified Network - No Connection" when plugged into router.
- Unable to see NAT translations using `show ip nat translations`.
- Router did not recognize `ip inspect` commands due to IOS license limitations (securityk9 license was not active).
- Client machines had incorrect or autoconfigured IPs (169.254.x.x) indicating no DHCP.
- Ping to external IPs like 8.8.8.8 failed initially.
- Gateway of last resort was misconfigured as `0.0.0.0` to `0.0.0.0`, indicating no proper default route.

### Actions Taken:
- Reset router to factory defaults to clear any misconfigurations.
- Re-plugged cables directly to router ports.
- Verified physical connections and IP assignments on router interfaces.
- Chose consistent private IP range (switched from 192.168.x.x to 172.16.x.x, then to 10.x.x.x for LAN).
- Ensured GigabitEthernet0/1 (WAN) interface was getting IP via DHCP.
- Configured ACL and NAT properly.

-----------------------------------------

## Step 2: Clean Configuration

- Configured interfaces:


interface GigabitEthernet0/0

 description LAN - Internal Network
 
 ip address 10.10.10.1 255.255.255.0

 ip nat inside

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 
 description WAN - ISP
 
 ip address dhcp
 
 ip nat outside

Created ACL permitting LAN subnet:

access-list 1 permit 10.10.10.0 0.0.0.255


Configured NAT overload:


ip nat inside source list 1 interface GigabitEthernet0/1 overload


Step 3: Verification

Verified routing table showing:

Connected LAN subnet 10.10.10.0/24

DHCP assigned WAN IP in 172.16.230.0/24

Default route pointing to WAN interface IP

Tested ping to external IP 8.8.8.8 from router (initially failed, then succeeded after correct config).

Verified NAT translations were created after generating traffic.

Confirmed client PC received proper IP and gateway from router and could access internet.

Summary of Troubleshooting

| Problem                             | Cause / Observation                       | Resolution                                      |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| No connection on Ethernet interface | Incorrect IP scheme, no DHCP, wrong cabling | Reset router, verify physical connections, use consistent IP scheme (10.x.x.x) |
| `ip inspect` command not recognized | Missing active securityk9 license       | Accepted EULA or bypassed for now; used manual NAT instead |
| NAT translations not showing       | No traffic generated or incomplete config | Added ACL, configured NAT overload, generated traffic |
| Client auto IP (169.254.x.x)       | No DHCP or no connection to router      | Verified router interface up, client connected properly, assigned correct IP |
| Ping to internet failed            | No default route or WAN interface down  | Confirmed WAN DHCP lease, ensured default route from DHCP was set |


| Final Notes                             | Explanation / Advice                                         |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Always verify physical connections    | Check cables and interfaces before troubleshooting IP issues |
| Keep IP addressing consistent         | Using one private IP scheme (e.g., 10.x.x.x) reduces confusion |
| Confirm license status early           | Missing licenses can disable key features like inspection/NAT |
| Use basic NAT with ACL as fallback     | When advanced features aren’t available, standard NAT and ACL work well |
| Verify DHCP assignments on WAN         | Router getting IP, gateway, and DNS from ISP is crucial     |
| Restart fresh if configs get messy     | Sometimes a reset and starting over is faster than troubleshooting unknown configs |
| Generate traffic to test NAT           | NAT translations don’t show until traffic flows through router |
| Use `show` commands liberally          | `show ip int brief`, `show ip route`, `show access-list` help identify issues quickly |
