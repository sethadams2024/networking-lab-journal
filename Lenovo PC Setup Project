Hello!

This is to cover a pc I got from a family friend.

My code must have been deleted due to my error, so here is what has happened so far:

- I looked into the PC, no GPU, so it runs on the CPU.
- 12GB of DDR3-1600 MHZ
- Couldn't get into the user's account and so I wiped the whole thing clean

The reset process was stuck on 22%, so I forced it to shut down, and then I powered it on. Now it is Windows setup for Windows 10.

I forgot to disconnect the internet to bypass user creation, but it's fine. I made sure to limit every bit of control Microsoft can have since it's a very old computer.
