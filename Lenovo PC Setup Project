Hello!

This is to cover a pc I got from a family friend.

My code must have been deleted due to my error, so here is what has happened so far:

- I looked into the PC, no GPU, so it runs on the CPU.
- 12GB of DDR3-1600 MHZ
- Couldn't get into the user's account and so I wiped the whole thing clean

The reset process was stuck on 22%, so I forced it to shut down, and then I powered it on. Now it is Windows setup for Windows 10.

I forgot to disconnect the internet to bypass user creation, but it's fine. I made sure to limit every bit of control Microsoft can have since it's a very old computer.

I got into the system and looked around
- created two system accounts to eventually test password resets with

I updated the system to a new software version, and it's been slow, but it's expected. I will "Submit a ticket" to resolve the issue by installing a new SSD when the system clears.
then it will teach me how to clone the OS and then move the boot to the SSD (need the UEFI for that)
