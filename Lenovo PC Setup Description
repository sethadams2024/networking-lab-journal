This is over an old Lenovo PC that I was able to get from a family friend

I was told this thing has not been on for years, so I am going with caution.

I was able to turn it on successfully, and it booted to the OS, Windows OS

Unfortunately, the only account on it does not work, I will need to find a way in

System information:
- No GPU
- 12GB (1 stick of 8 and 1 stick of 4 1600 MHz DDR3)

My Attempts to get into PC
- I tried other passwords
- Held shift and restarted the  computer to bring up advanced settings:
    - I had to reset the PC fully, which was okay. I could not get to see if there was data available. Maybe I can look later?
    - It will take a while for it to finish resetting
