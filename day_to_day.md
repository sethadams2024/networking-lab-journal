Day 1
- I was able to purchase some items from a garage sale:
  1. D-Link DIR-615 N router. It has 4 LAN ports and wireless connectivity.
  2. Cat 5e. I needed another cable to use the D-Link and my PC with Ethernet.
  3. A new Type C hub that offers Ethernet connectivity for my Surface Pro 7. I did not have one with my other version.
  4. A NetGear Base Station VMB3000. I now understand that this is useless unless I make huge changes to its items.
 
  Here are my Plans for the upcoming weeks
  - Take out the insides of the NetGear and put a Raspberry Pi in it to detect my internet traffic by hiding it as another device.
  Connect the D-Link, configure it in different ways, and learn about what it can do. I also saw that I could flash something onto it to make it more powerful.
  - I am also a Master's student in Information Science, and that is a higher priority.
  - I am also studying for A+ certification, and doing Cisco's "Network Technician" Badge course.
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Setting up the D-Link**
- Connected the main Ethernet cable to the device.
 LAN1 to my gaming PC for configuration. Interestingly, it started working, though the reason remains unclear.
- Unable to access the configuration menu due to the previous owner changing the password, despite instructions not to do so.
- Resolved by holding the reset button for 15 using my new "Mechmax" screwdriver set, which highly recommend for small screws and tools- Configured the device as Dynamic IP, and the system is operational., due to its age, the speed is capped at approximately 94 Mbps.

Configuring various settings
- Updated the time by the NTP (Network Time Protocol) to time.google.com, which successfully connected.
- Saved the configuration to prepare for an update.

UPDATE:
The update made a critical mistake, resulting in the router being bricked and rendered completely inaccessible. Despite numerous recovery attempts, it remains offline.

TL: The first day of using the router failed, as it was bricked beyond repair.

Now that it is nonfunctional, I have decided toassemble it to examine its components. Screenshots will be added to the wikiUpdate: The router has fully dis. This concludes Day 1.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day 2
- Today, I was very busy with other priorities. But I made progress nonetheless.
- I finished the RAM chapter of A+, now onto BIOS tomorrow. I need to read around 20 pages a day if I want to be ready by June 17.  Actually, with my honeymoon, I need to push it to July
- I also bought new network equipment. I bought a NETGEAR 5-Port Gigabit Ethernet Easy Smart Managed Essentials Switch (GS305E). This time I will not brick it!
- I got a N300 Wifi Router 2.4 GHz Easy Setup. Up to 300Mbps. It's not great, but I still want to try setting it up in my bedroom.
- Side note: Want to slowly upgrade my old gaming PC with parts during this journey. Stay Tuned. On to day 3!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day 3 04.13.25
- I redid my RAM quiz and got 10/10. I wonder why I answered these questions a different way. 

- I completed the Udemy Firmware section. On to the book now. I never realized that the UEFI was an updated BIOS; I thought it was just a BIOS. I also didn't know about POST, Boot passwords, and how the power good wire for the CPU to start BIOS (UEFI)

- I have other items to do, I shall return.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day 4 4.14.25

- Master's Class: I am starting tomorrow for Module 3
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day 5 4.15.25

- Didn't get to do much, but I started chipping away at module 3 on my Master's!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day 6 4.16.25
- Got the (new) PC from a family friend, now I will try to get into the OS and start learning. It is taking forever to reset.
- Finally reset, now just organizing my desk for two PC's. 
- I think it might be best to look into VirtualBox and even a ticketing service, and make fake tickets and organize my thoughts as I learn.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day 7 (1 week) 4.17.25
Network equipment came in last night, and now I am in the process of setting it up.
- Due to having two PC's and now 2 HDMI cables, 2 power cables, and 2 Ethernet cables. I had to use some tape to tie it together and cable manage. 
- I will start configuring the equipment tomorrow. Please look at the "Creating a LAN" Project folder.
- I decided to turn from my Udemy course and follow Professor Messor when it comes to learning A+

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day 8 4.18
- Set up the switch and the Wifi Router (now a dumb AP).

- Build a home network module in the "Network Tech" cisco learning academy course
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day 9 4.19
- I completed module 3 of my Advanced Programming Class for my Master's and am about halfway through.
- Started going full into Professor Messor and the textbook. I watch the videos, take notes of items I do not know, then skim and document anything new as I go.
- I finished the "Defensive Security Intro" for Try Hack Me, now on to "What is networking
- Considering taking the coursecareers IT Support course.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day 10 4.20
- Just about wrapped up Section 1 of 1101. I am about 20 pages from the end of the book
- I plan on watching the study sessions over the past 3 years after I finish Module 2, so I can start practicing.
- I want to get a thumb drive to install Linux on, so that I can dual-boot the Lenovo workstation pc.
- Have not found a ticketing platform yet. I will also install VirtualBox soon to test it out.
  My main priorities right now:
  1. Pass my master class
  3. Pass Core 1 and 2 of A+. A+ will help me in the right direction for the lab pc.
- Finished Section 1 of 1101, I got about 12.5% out of the possible 15% on the quizzes at the end of each chapter. On to networking, which is 20%. I think my biggest challenge is port #'s, but I need to study them on Anki
- Completed "WHAT IS NETWORKING" by tryhackme
  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day 11 4.21
- Passed Module 3 of my R class

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day 19 4.29

- Now, should I go from A+ to Sec+? Sec+ opens more doors, and I am learning networking from the Cisco Networking Academy. I can then go back to N+ later.
