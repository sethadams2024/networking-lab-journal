# networking-lab-journal
This is a journal to log the various networking projects, labs, and certification learning I am doing daily.

Ultimate Goals of my journal:
- Get into networking
- Break into the IT field.
- Show the knowledge I have gained, the mistakes I have made, and much more.

Day 1
- I was able to purchase some items from a garage sale:
  1. D-Link DIR-615 Okayless N router. It has 4 LAN ports and wireless connectivity.
  2. Device of Cat 5e. I needed another cable to use the D-Link and my PC with Ethernet.
  3. A new Type C hub that offers Ethernet connectivity for my Surface Pro 7. I did not have one with my other version.
  4. A NetGear Base Station VMB3000. I now understand that this is completely useless unless I make huge changes to its items.
 
  Here are my Plans for the upcoming weeks
  - Take out the insides of the NetGear and put a Raspberry Pi in it to detect my internet traffic by hiding it as another device.
  Connect the D-Link, configure it in different ways, and learn about what it can do. I also saw that I could flash something onto it to make it more powerful.
  - I am also a Master's student in Information Science, and that is a higher priority.
  - I am also studying for A+ certification, and doing Cisco's "Network Technician" Badge course.

**Setting up the D-Link**
- Plugged the main Ethernet into it:
- Plugged LANN1 into my gaming pc to configure it
      - Interestingly enough, it started working immediately. I don't understand why yet.
- Ok, I cannot access the configuration menu and need to reset the thing. The device says not to change the password, but the previous owner did otherwise.
- Figured it out, held the reset for 15 seconds with my new screwdriver set "Mechmax" highly recommend for small screws and smaller needed tools.
- After configuring it as a Dynamic IP, the system is up. Due to being very old, I am maxed at roughly 94 Mbps.

Configuring various sUptings
- I had to update the time, so I found how to set the NTP (Network Time Protocol) to time.google.co,m and it connected!
- Have to update it, which means I need to save the config before updating

UPDATE:
THAT WAS THE WORST MISTAKE I HAVE EVER MADE. I bricked the router and cannot access it at all. I have tried just about everything, and nothing is working to get it back online.ne

TLDR: I bricked and killed my first router on the first day. 


Now that it's dead, basically, I am going to open it and see the parts of it. I will put screenshots in the wiki!
Update: It has been taken apart. That is it for Day 1!

Day 2
- Today, I was very busy with other priorities. But I made progress nonetheless.
- I finished the RAM chapter of A+, now onto BIOS tomorrow. I need to read around 20 pages a day if I want to be ready by June 17.  Actually, with my honeymoon, I need to push it to July
- I also bought new network equipment. I bought a NETGEAR 5-Port Gigabit Ethernet Easy Smart Managed Essentials Switch (GS305E). This time I will not brick it!
- I got a N300 Wifi Router 2.4 GHz Easy Setup. up to 300Mbps. It's not great, but I still want to try setting it up in my bedroom.
- Side note: Want to slowly upgrade my old gaming PC with parts during this journey. Stay Tuned. On to day 3!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day 3 04.13.25
I redid my RAM quiz and got 10/10. I wonder why I answered these questions a different way. 

I completed the Udemy Firmware section. On to the book now. I never realized that the UEFI was an updated BIOS; I thought it was just a BIOS. I also didn't know about POST, Boot passwords, and how the power good wire for the CPU to start BIOS (UEFI)

I have other items to do, I shall return.

Day 4 4.14.25

Mark this day as the day I change and become full-on into this networking thing

A+: Finished Firmware Section and now learning Motherboards
Cisco Network Technician Course: Learning about setting up home networks
Master's Class: I am starting tomorrow for Module 3
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day 5 4.15.25

Didn't get to do much, but I started chipping away at module 3 on my Master's!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day 6 4.16.25
Got the (new) PC from a family friend, now I will try to get into the OS and start learning. It is taking forever to reset.
Finally reset, now just organizing my desk for two PC's. 
I think it might be best to look into VirtualBox and even a ticketing service, and make fake tickets and organize my thoughts as I learn.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day 7 (1 week) 4.17.25
Network equipment came in last night, and now I am in the process of setting it up
- Due to having two PC's and now 2 HDMI cables, 2 power cables, and 2 Ethernet cables. I had to use some tape to tie it together and cable manage. 
- I will start configuring the equipment tomorrow. Please look at the "Creating a LAN" Project folder.
- I decided to turn from my Udemy course and follow Professor Messor when it comes to learning A+

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day 8 4.18
- Set up the switch and the Wifi Router (now a dumb AP).
- Working on Defensive Security Intro from TryHackMe (completed)
- Build a home network module in the "Network Tech" cisco learning academy course
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day 9 4.19
- I completed module 3 of my Advanced Programming Class for my Master's, and I am about halfway through now.
- Started going full into Professor Messor and the textbook. I watch the videos, take notes of items I do not know, then skim and document anything new as I go.
- I finished the "Defensive Security Intro" for Try Hack Me, now on to "What is networking
- Considering taking the coursecareers IT Support course.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day 10 4.20
- Just about wrapped up Section 1 of 1101. I am about 20 pages from the end of the book
- I plan on watching the study sessions over the past 3 years after I finish Module 2, so I can start practicing.
- I want to get a thumb drive to install Linux on, so that I can dual-boot the Lenovo workstation pc.
- Have not found a ticketing platform yet. I will also install VirtualBox soon to test it out.
  My main priorities right now:
  1. Pass my master class
  2. Pass Core 1 and 2 of A+. A+ will help me in the right direction for the lab pc.
