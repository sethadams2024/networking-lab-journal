<h1> Hello! This document is about the process of installing VirtualBox on my Microsoft Surface Pro and getting Ubuntu installed on it.</h1>

1. I initially went to the website for Virtual Box
(https://www.bing.com/search?pglt=2337&q=virtualbox&cvid=c26ea576708f4a78ab82d9f8844bb551&gs_lcrp=EgRlZGdlKgkIABBFGDsY-QcyCQgAEEUYOxj5BzIGCAEQRRg5MgYIAhBFGDwyBggDEEUYPDIGCAQQRRg9MgYIBRBFGDwyBggGEEUYPNIBCDEwNTBqMGoxqAIAsAIA&FORM=ANNTA1&PC=U531)

2. I ran into the error that I did not have C++ 2019 installed on my computer to install the program file. Here is where I found the files to install the needed firmware:

3. I installed it and then successfully installed VirtualBox.
4. Once I got into it, I had to choose an operating system to log into. I chose Ubuntu
5. I went to the download page x64 for 24.04.2 https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop#newsletter-signup
